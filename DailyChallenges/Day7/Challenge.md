# Day 7 Challenge: Hands-On Jenkins Magic: Build, Test, Deploy a Flask App!

Hello Learners,

Welcome back to the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge! ðŸŽ‰

Today, youâ€™ll explore the power of CI/CD automation by setting up a Jenkins pipeline for a Python Flask application. </br>This hands-on challenge will help you understand the essentials of CI/CD practices, including testing, containerization, and automated deployment.



## Requirements:
### Pipeline Setup:
- Clone the Repository:
  Use the following GitHub repository for the Python Flask app:
    [Flask Example App](https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/main/examples/tutorial)</br>

- Set Up the Environment:
  Install dependencies using pip and create a Python virtual environment.

- Run Unit Tests:
  Execute unit tests using pytest to validate the app.

- Build a Docker Image:
  Use a Dockerfile to containerize the application.

- Push Docker Image:
  Push the image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

- Deploy the Application:
  Deploy the container locally, exposing it on port 5000.

## Why This Matters:
CI/CD pipelines are the backbone of modern DevOps workflows, enabling rapid, reliable application development and deployment. </br>By completing this challenge, you'll enhance your skills in setting up robust automation for Python-based applications.



## Submission Guidelines:
- GitHub Repository:
  Upload your Jenkinsfile, Dockerfile, and any scripts or configurations used.

- Documentation:
  Include a README.md file explaining your pipeline steps, challenges faced, and key learnings.

- Share Your Progress:
  Post your experience on social media with hashtags: #getfitwithsagar, #SRELife, #DevOpsForAll.

## Bonus Tasks:
- Notifications:
  Set up email or Slack notifications to inform team members of building successes or failures.
- Code Quality Checks:
  Integrate a static code analysis tool like SonarQube or flake8 to enforce code quality standards.

If you missed any previous challenges, you can catch up by reviewing the problem statements on GitHub.
